# AsthmaHeroes

Unity · Health Education · Serious Game

Asthma Heroes is a serious game developed in Unity by me alone to help children learn how to manage their asthma through playful, interactive experiences. 
Designed as part of the Breathing Games open-source initiative, the game combines educational content with engaging gameplay to teach self-care strategies in a fun and accessible way. 
It supports respiratory therapy goals through intuitive UX and has been used in pediatric health contexts as both a learning and engagement tool.
